# Creating Custom PHP Stan Rules For Your Codebase

<br/>

## Static Analysis with PHP Stan

One of the most helpful things you can do for codebase is introduce some _static analysis tools_. These are tools that look at your code not to determine runtime errors, but to check if it follow certain syntactical rules. Eslint, Rust-Analyzer, and even Typescript itself (to some degree) could be considered static analysis tools. Psalm and [PHP Stan](https://phpstan.org/) are the main choices for most Laravel/PHP applications.

<br />

<br />

### An Example in Code

We recently ran into this bug in our software when we reset a user's subscription information after their automatic renewal:
```php
$subscriptionStart = Carbon::now();
$subscriptionExpiration = Carbon::now()->addYear();

/* other code */

$userSubscription->update([
    'purchased_at'  => $subscriptionStart,
    'expires_at'    => $subscriptionExpiration
]);
```
It might look fine to your eyes, and unfortunately wasn't caught in the test since saving this would be successful. However, there's a nasty bug here. 

<br/>

**Carbon** is another common datetime package for PHP/Laravel projects, but has some quirks. One of these is that this instance is shared on your application. This means that our first call to `Carbon::now()` has accidentally been changed by the second line. 

<br />

Carbon does have a way we can avoid this, which is just making sure that we use a `CarbonImmutable` class instead.
```php
// No more bugs!
$subscriptionStart = CarbonImmutable::now();
$subscriptionExpiration = CarbonImmutable::now()->addYear();
```
Okay, great! We've fixed the problem. But how can prevent this in the future ðŸ¤”?

<br />

<br />

## Creating Custom PHP Stan Rules

The strategy we decided to take, is to always use the `CarbonImmutable` class instead of the base `Carbon` class. PHP Stan is very cool in that it lets us create custom rules, provided that we know how to write them. Let's make a custom rule that will allow us to check that we only use the right class.

<br />

### Writing a Test File

First things first, let's decide what we need to test. Inside of a folder, we'll create a new class that's violating this rule. This one is importing Carbon to use as the return value:
```php
// tests/phpstan/no-carbon-imports.php

use Carbon\Carbon;

class Foo {
    public function(): Carbon{
        return now();
    }
}

```
We need to set up a couple more files here as well. We need the actual test itself, and we need to update the PHP Stan config file. Let's create our rule first:
```php
// App\Support\phpstan\NoCarbonImports.php
namespace App\Support\phpstan;

use PhpParser\Node;
use PHPStan\Analyser\Scope;
use PHPStan\Rules\Rule;

class NoCarbonImports implements Rule {
    public function getNodeType(): string{
        return \PhpParser\Node::class;
    }
    
    public function processNode(Node\Expr|Node $node, Scope $scope): array{
        var_dump($node);
        return [];
    }
}

```

and update our Stan config:
```
// phpstan.dist.neon
rules:
    - App\Support\phpstan\NoCarbonImports

```

<br />

### Analyzing the Syntax

Great, now that we've got that finished, let's start checking the file. We can run the following command to analyze only our single file, which will dump all of the node information from our syntax parser. 

<br />

`vendor/bin/phpstan analyse -l 8 --debug /tests/phpstan/no-carbon-imports.php`

<br />

This will ouput the names of a lot of nodes and their types. Essentially, these static analysis tools focus not on the content of your code, but the structure, called an [Abstract Syntax Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree). If you've ever written a compiler or transplier before, you'll recognize this concept. I find these small examples the easiest to understand by checking each part and trying to tie it to your code. Since ours should be the first line or two of our test file, we will eventually see the node of our AST that we want to use, a `PhpParser\Node\Stmt\UseUse::class`. Let's add that to our rule:
```php
public function getNodeType(): string{
    return \PhpParser\Node\Stmt\UseUse::class;
}
```
Depending on what we need to see here, we might have to dig deeper into the node structure to find what we are looking for. In our case, we want to get the name of this node, and the select each part of the name of our import. In the next function, let's dump that:
```php
public function processNode(Node\Expr|Node $node, Scope $scope): array{
    var_dump($node->name->parts); // ['Carbon', 'Carbon']
    return [];
}
```

<br />

### Creating Our Rule

Now we need to just write our rule. We want to check if we have an import from `Carbon` that is not using `CarbonImmutable`. If we have no errors, we return an empty array. If we do have errors, we need to return a `RuleErrorBuilder` which is part of PHP Stan.

<br />

Here's our finished rule!
```php
// App\Support\phpstan\NoCarbonImports.php
namespace App\Support\phpstan;

use PhpParser\Node;
use PHPStan\Analyser\Scope;
use PHPStan\Rules\Rule;
use PHPStan\Rules\RuleErrorBuilder;

class OnlyCarbonImmutableImports implements Rule {
    public function getNodeType(): string{
        return \PhpParser\Node\Stmt\UseUse::class;
    }
    
    public function processNode(Node\Expr|Node $node, Scope $scope): array{
        $importSections = $node->name?->parts ?? [];
        
        if(array_search('Carbon', $importSections, true) !== false &&
            array_search('CarbonImmutable', $importSections, true) === false &&
        ){
            return [
                RuleErrorBuilder::message(
                    'Cannot use Carbon\Carbon, only CarbonImmutable and CarbonInterface imports are allowed'
                )->build(),
            ];
        }
        
        return [];
    }
}

```

<br />

### Updating Our Baseline
All that's left to do is update our baseline file. We'll run the following:

<br />

`vendor/bin/phpstan analyse clear-result-cache && vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --generate-baseline`

<br />

This will create a new `phpstan-baseline.neon` file in our repo so that we can prevent the issue now and have a backlog of places to solve this in the future!

<br />

<br />

## Conclusion

Using static analysis tools to create these custom rules can be a fantastic way to clean up your codebase and make sure things aren't missed in code review. If you're interested in learning more about Abstract Syntax Trees or PHP Stan rules, check out [their documentation](https://phpstan.org/developing-extensions/abstract-syntax-tree) to see a bit more behind the scenes. 

<br />

I also recommend spending some time writing a compiler. [I recently completed one in Rust](https://github.com/Bryce-Stabenow/rust-compiler-for-tiny-basic) if you'd like to check it out! It taught me a great deal about AST parsing and understanding how code syntax takes its shape.
